/** 
 * @brief This represents a basic block in the control flow graph (CFG).
 *
 * The first Instruction is always a LabelInstr. \a begin_ points to it. <br>
 *
 * Then there are zero or more PhiInstr instances. \a firstPhi_ points to the 
 * first PhiInstr. \a firstOrdinary_ points to the first Instruction which is 
 * \em NOT a PhiInstr. If there are zero PhiInstr instances, \a firstPhi_ = 
 * \a firstOrdinary_. <br>
 *
 * Then there are zero or more regular instructions. This means \em NO
 * LabelInstr instances and \em NO PhiInstr instances. Furthermore if there is a
 * GotoInstr or a BranchInstr this will be the last instruction in this
 * BasicBlock. Thus the last instruction in a basic block is either a regular
 * Instruction or a JumpInstr<br>
 * 
 * \a end_ points to the LabelInstr of the next BasicBlock, which is the first
 * instruction which does not belong to this BasicBlock. If this LabelInstr
 * does not exist it points to the sentinel of the Function's instrList_.<br>
 * <br>
 *
 * So here are some examples how to iterate over groups of instructions: <br>
 *
 * All instructions: <br>
 * for (iter = bb->begin_; iter != bb->end_; ++iter) <br><br>
 * 
 * All instructions without the leading LabelInstr: <br>
 * for (iter = bb->firstPhi_; iter != bb->end_; ++iter) <br><br>
 * or: 
 *
 * All PhiInstr instances if any. Note that the loop isn't executed at all when
 * there is no PhiInstr at all: <br>
 * for (iter = bb->firstPhi_; iter != bb->firstOrdinary_; ++iter) <br><br>
 *
 * All ordinary instructions, if any: <br>
 * for (iter = bb->firstOrdinary_; iter != bb->end_; ++iter) <br><br>
