Swift is a compiler for a programming language with the same name.
Current backend is for amd64 Linux systems.
However you can compiler and run swift on other archs as well.


REQUIREMENTS
- bison
- flex
- cmake
- yasm (to assemble the output file)
- gcc


INSTALLING

$ cmake .
$ make

You can now symlink the executable to /usr/bin.
For example:
$ su
$ ln -s /home/username/swiftc/swift /usr/bin/.

If you use KDE you can get syntax highlighting with proper symlinking.
For example:
$ cd contrib
$ su
$ ln -sf /home/username/swiftc/contrib/swift.xml /usr/kde/3.5/share/apps/katepart/syntax/.

The last command depends on your Linux distro and/or KDE verions, of course.
