INSTALLING

Currently there is no way to really install the compiler. However, this must be
done to use it:
$ cmake .
$ make

Perhaps you want to try the benchmark. Just run
$ ./mk_benchmark.sh
This is currently a work in progress

If you want to try the other samples:
$ ./swiftc test/fibonacci.swift && ./test/fibonacci.swift.out
$ ./swiftc test/fac.swift && ./test/fac.swift.out
$ ./swiftc test/sdl_gl.swift -- -lGL -lGLU -lSDL && ./test/sdl_gl.swift.out

In Vim you can get highlighting with the syntax file provided in contrib/swift.vim

If you want to use the memory leak finder copy or symlink utils/leakfinder to
/usr/bin or another location in your path:
$ ln -s /home/username/swiftc/utils/leakfinder /usr/bin/.
