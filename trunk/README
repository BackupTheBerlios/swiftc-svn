INSTALLING

$ cmake .
$ make

You can now symlink the executable to /usr/bin.
For example:
$ su
$ ln -s /home/username/swiftc/swift /usr/bin/.

If you use KDE you can get syntax highlighting with proper symlinking.
For example:
$ cd contrib
$ su
$ ln -sf /home/username/swiftc/contrib/swift.xml /usr/kde/3.5/share/apps/katepart/syntax/.

The last command depends on your Linux distro and/or KDE verions, of course.

In Vim you can get highlighting with the syntax file provided in contrib/swift.vim

If you want to use the memory leak finder copy or symlink utils/leakfinder to
/usr/bin or another location in your path:
$ ln -s /home/username/swiftc/utils/leakfinder /usr/bin/.
