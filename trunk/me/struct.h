/**
 * @brief With Member you can build a complex layout of data types, 
 * which all have an at compile time known offset to the base pointer.
 *
 * Member instances are types for locations in member. This is a different thing
 * than spilled locals of type \a me::Op::Type: 
 * The middle-end assumes that there are infinit registers available. Spilling
 * is only a product of the fact, they are limited in reality.
 *
 * \a Member is the base class for all more complex data types. It is assumed
 * that in a first pass all \a Struct objects are registered as types. In a
 * second pass all member can be added. 
 *
 * Each Member is given a unique 'name': \a nr_. However this name is only
 * needed when it is used within a Struct.
 * 
 * Each \a Member class must implement \a analyze. This must be invoked on all
 * root data types. \a size_ and \a offset_ will be calculated there.
 *
 * \a parent_ points to the parent Struct type. \a size_ and \a offset_ are 
 * calculated relative to that. If it does not belong to a parent Struct
 * or this is a root Struct set it to 0.
 *
 * For better debugging you can use the \a id_ member.
