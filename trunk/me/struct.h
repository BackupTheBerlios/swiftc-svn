 * @brief With Aggregate you can build a complex layout of data types, 
 * which all have an at compile time known offset to the base.
 *
 * Aggregate instances are types for locations in memory. This is a different thing
 * than spilled locals of type \a me::Op::Type: 
 * The middle-end assumes that there are infinit registers available. Spilling
 * is only a product of the fact, they are limited in reality.
 *
 * \a Aggregate is the base class for all more complex data types. It is assumed
 * that in a first pass all \a Struct objects are registered as types. In a
 * second pass all members can be added. 
 *
 * Each \a Aggregate instance has a unique \a nr_ which can be used for lookups.
 *
 * Each \a Aggregate class must implement \a analyze. This must be invoked on all
 * root data types. \a size_ and \a offset_ will be calculated there.
 *
 * For better debugging you can use the \a id_ member.
